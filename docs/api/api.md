## Array
### `any(functor, scope)` 
Returns a boolean graph that resolves to *true* if at least one element in the array
passes the test implemented by the provided functor.
```js
const { root } = require('carmi')
const instance = createInstance({
    output: root.any((value, index) => value.eq(2))
}, [3, 2, 1])
instance.output //true
```
### `append(value)` 🍬
Returns an array graph with an additional element (value) at the end.

### `assign()` 
Combines all array values of the object. Like: `_.reduce(NativeType, _.assign, {})`

### `compact()` 🍬
Resolves to the same array, with only `true` values

### `concat(arrays)` 🍬
Resolves to an array which is a concatenated results of NativeType and one or more additional arrays.

### `defaults()` 
Combines all array values of the object, in reverse order. Like: `_.reduce(NativeType, _.defaults, {})`

### `every(functor, scope)` 🍬
Returns a boolean graph that resolves to true if running the functor on all of the array's items resolved to true.

### `filter(functor, scope)` 
Returns an array graph containing only the values for which the functor resolved to `true`.
```js
const { root } = require('carmi')
const instance = createInstance({
    output: root.filter( item => item.mod(2))
}, [3, 2, 1])
instance.output //[3, 1]
```
### `find(functor, scope)` 🍬
Resolves to the first value for which the functor resolves to `true`.

### `findIndex(functor, scope)` 🍬
Resolved to the index of the first value for which the functor resolved to true, or -1 if not found.

### `flatten()` 
Flattens inner arrays into an array.

### `head()` 🍬
Resolves to the first item in an array.

### `includes(value)` 🍬

### `keyBy(functor, scope)` 
Returns an object graph that resolves to an object containing keys returned by functor, pointing to their first found corresponding value.
```js
const { root, chain } = require('carmi');
const instance = createInstance({
  output: root
    .keyBy(item => item.get('items').size())
    .mapValues(item => item.get('items'))
}, [{items: [1]}, {items: [1, 2]}, {items: [1, 2, 3]}, {items: [1, 2, 3, 4]}]);

```
### `last()` 🍬

### `map(functor, scope)`

```js
const { root } = require('carmi')
const instance = createInstance({
    output: root.map( item => item.mult(2))
}, [3, 2, 1])
instance.output //[6, 4, 2]
```
### `recursiveMap(functor, scope)` 
Resolves to an array with size identical to NativeType, with each element resolving to the result of functor on the equivalent element in NativeType.
The functor is given a "loop" parameter, which can be used to retrieve the functor's result on a different key. For example:

### `reduce(functor, initialValue)` 🍬
Returns a value that is a result of running functor on all the items of the array in order, each time with the previous result of functor.

### `chain(t)` 
Wraps a native JS object with the declarative APIs.
```js
const { root, chain } = require('carmi');
 const instance = createInstance({
   output: chain([{

     books: [ root.get(1).get(root.get(0).get('shelf')).get(0) ]
  }])
  .assign()
 }, [{shelf: 'scifi'}, {scifi: ['a scanner darkly']}]);
 instance.output //{books: ["a scanner darkly"], shelf: "scifi"}
```
### `effect(func, args)` 
See the docs for [`effect(func, args)`](api.html#effectfunc-args-1) in the **Graph** section of this API reference.

### `implement(iface, name)` 
Uses a previously declared abstract clause and assigns an actual value to the named abstract.

Logical operand or.

### `push(path)` 
Declare a setter that adds an element to the end of an array. The setter will create the array if one doesn't exist.

### `setter(path)` 
Declare actions which can be triggered on your state to change it (use arg0/arg1/arg2 - to define placeholders in the path).
```js
const { root, setter, arg0 } = require('carmi')
const instance = createInstance({
    setItem: setter(arg0),
    output: root.any((value, index) => value.eq(2))
}, [3, 2, 1]);
console.log(instance.output) //true
instance.setItem(1, 3)
instance.output //false
```
### `splice(path)` 
Declare actions which can be triggered on your state to change it (use arg0/arg1/arg2 - to define placeholders in the path).

### `template(template, placeholders)` 
This api creates a string using carmi models and the template string method.
```js
const { root, template } = require('carmi');
const instance = createInstance({
  output: template`Second array item is:${root.get(1)}.`
}, [3, 2, 1]);
instance.output //Second array item is:2.
```
### `withName(name, g)`
