instance.output //true
```
### `append(value)` üç¨

The functor is given a "loop" parameter, which can be used to retrieve the functor's result on a different key. For example:

### `reduce(functor, initialValue)` üç¨

### `and(a)` 
logical operand and

### `bind(func)`

### `chain(t)` 
wraps a native JS object with the declarative APIs
```js
const { root, chain } = require('carmi');
 const instance = createInstance({
   output: chain([{
     shelf: root.get(0).get('shelf'),
     books: [ root.get(1).get(root.get(0).get('shelf')).get(0) ]
  }])
  .assign()
 }, [{shelf: 'scifi'}, {scifi: ['a scanner darkly']}]);
 instance.output //{books: ["a scanner darkly"], shelf: "scifi"}
```
### `effect(func, args)` 
Like call but will exectue even if the parameters mutation resulted in the same values.<br/>
**Please note**: `effect(func, args)` is a leaf and ends the chain, and its return value cannot be used.

### `implement(iface, name)` 
uses a previously declared abstract clause and assigns an actual value to the named abstract

### `or(a, b)` 
logical operand or

### `push(path)` 
declare a setter that adds an element to the end of an array. The setter will create the array if it doesn't exist

### `setter(path)` 
declare actions which can be triggered on your state to change it (use arg0/arg1/arg2 - to define placeholders in the path)

### `splice(path)` 
declare actions which can be triggered on your state to change it (use arg0/arg1/arg2 - to define placeholders in the path)

### `withName(name, g)` 
this is a dubug feature which allows to name the actual projection functions on the carmi root
